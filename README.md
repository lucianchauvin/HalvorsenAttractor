# Strange Attractors
Strange Attractors are a set of 3D parametric derivatives that describe the gradient of an oscillating system. They were discovered/derived while using the Navier-Stokes equation to study oscillating systems such as chemical reactions and weather patterns. I decided to research them and from my research, I produced this project. The main product of this project can be found [here](https://lucianchauvin.com/StrangeAttractors), a website where you can change the color, length, and equations that describe these beautiful systems. Since they are 3D you can also spin them around and zoom in and out. I first learned about these systems a while ago from a coding train [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0lkz2gSsIk) and my other sources to find and understand these strange attractors are found below.

# Modeling On TAMU Computing Cluster
Since there are certain points that either are stable or blow up to infinity I wanted to try to graph this region. These are some of the results:
